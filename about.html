        <p>My name is Sherman Hewitt, and I’m a student at the University of Miami.
          I study Computer Science, but ever since boyhood,
          I’ve had a knack for writing. Yet, I never knew what to write about, so in a sense,
          I was a prose-less writer for quite some time.
          </p>

          <p>Then I discovered the newspaper during college.
          At first I was shy, keeping my desire to write to myself.
          I couldn’t possibly fathom my work being seen by newspaper editors, let alone the world!
          But one step led to another, and I eventually had my first story published.
          Since then, I’ve been on a role.
          </p>

          <p>As of recent, I’ve tried to find ways to bridge the gap between
          my writing for both deadline and the command line.
          Ultimately, I wish to be a newsroom web developer,
          making cool applications that add an interactive layer to how stories are told.
          I’ve taken baby steps so far, looking into programming languages
          like Python and its accompanying web framework Flask, but lots of learning still lies ahead.
          That, I think, makes what I want to do all the more exciting.
